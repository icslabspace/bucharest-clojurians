Welcome to Bucharest Clojure Community Workspace!

This workspace is for anyone willing to learn and to share some knowledge about Clojure language (& friends: ClojureScript, Datomic) and its related tools and frameworks through:
* contributing to open source projects
* organizing talks & workshops 
* recommending interesting resources (books, conferences, courses, etc)

The members of this community are functional programming enthusiasts who share the same passion of designing and writing clean, efficient and focused software solutions using cool principles of mathematics and lambda calculus. Whether you are a beginner or an expert in functional programming, we would be happy to meet you and to share interesting ideas. Together, we would like to build a powerful community that will enable us to grow our technical skills and to open our minds. 

Please use the community's [slack channel](http://www.icslab.eu/slack) to chat with the other members.
